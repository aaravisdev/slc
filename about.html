		<h1>Aarav Makhija</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Aarav Makhija, and I am 12 years old. I love coding and learning new things about technology. I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and improve my skills, whether it's through coding challenges or personal projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games, reading books, or hanging out with my friends.</p>
